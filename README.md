# newsScraper

### scrapes the New York Times page for titles and links and stores them in mongodb

### allows users to comment on articles and visit the article on the originating web site

### user can manually scrape for new articles or clear the existing list of articles

## bugs:
#### location.reload() does not work following the clear, although it does following the scrape.
#### an article save feature is in the works but incomplete. the api end point exists but the onclick is not firing for some reason.
